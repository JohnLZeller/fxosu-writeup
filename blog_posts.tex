\subsection{Fall 2014}
\textbf{Week 5\\Friday, October 31, 2014\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start working on the requirements document
\item Continues to research on Firefox OS
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Problem statement finished
\item Technology review finished
\item Project blog and project site set up
\item Problem statement and technology review uploaded to the project site
\end{itemize}

\noindent This week we set up our project blog and project site using Sharepoint space. The project site is used to store and share documents we made such as the problem statement and technology review to the whole team. The project blog is used to keep track of our progress on this project. We posted our progress updates on the project blog every week so that our client can know what we are currently working on. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 6\\Friday, November 7, 2014\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Continues to work on the requirements document
\item Continues research (necko), get familiar with Web IDL specifications
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Finished the basic structure of the requirements document
\end{itemize}

\noindent We expect to finish the introduction and project description parts of the requirements document, and think of some requirements for this project in the next week. We create our first draft of the requirement document in Word format instead of LaTeX because it is easier for us to edit it online. We stored our requirement document on Google Drive and shared it to the whole team as well as our client so that every one in our team can work on the document at the same time. Also, our client can give us immediate feedback without sending email but simply add a line somewhere on the document. We followed the format provided in the assignment page and finished the basic structure of the requirements document at the end of this week. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 7\\Friday, November 14, 2014\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Continues to work on the requirements document
\item Finish the requirment parts of the requirements document
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Finished the introduction part of the requirements document
\end{itemize}

\noindent We continue to work on the requirement document in this week. We combined the words FxOS and OSU to FxOSU and decided to use it as our team name. Our progress on the requirement document was pretty slow because we have to do more research on Firefox OS at the same time. At the end of this week we finished the introduction part of the requirements document and filled in some requirements of the project. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 8\\Friday, November 21, 2014\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Finish the whole requirements document
\item Get the requirements document signed
\item Start working at the poster
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Finished the project description part of the requirements document
\end{itemize}

\noindent This week we were still working on the requirement document. We were a bit behind schedule and need to finish the requirement document as soon as possible in order to get feedback from our client and get it signed before Thanksgiving. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 9\\Friday, November 28, 2014\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Finish the poster
\item Start working on the preliminary design document
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirements document finished and submited
\item Requirements document uploaded to the project site
\item Start working on the poster
\end{itemize}

\noindent Finally we finished the requirements document and got it signed. The requirements document was also uploaded to the project site. We felt like we have a problem on our time management. To prevent similar thing happens, we need to check each other's schedule and have more time to work together. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 10\\Friday, December 5, 2014\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Finish the preliminary design document

\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Preliminary Poster finished
\item Preliminary Poster uploaded to the project site
\end{itemize}

\noindent This week we started working on the poster that we will be using in the Expo and got it finished in this week. Since this is only a preliminary design of the poster, we did not fill in all the contents. The poster have a blue background and orange header and it follows the Firefox OS branding guidelines.
\\\\
Two of our team members, John and Jonathan, went to Portland to meet with our client and engineers from Mozilla. We have a more clear direction on what we are going to do. \\
\\
\textbf{Finals Week\\Friday, December 12, 2014\\}
Fall 2014, Finals week: \\

\end{itemize}

\noindent This term we spent most of the time working on documents and research. Next term we will start working on the prototype of our API and we will later move on to the implementation in C++.
\\\\
This week is the end of Fall term. The blog will stop updating until next term.

\subsection{Winter 2015}
\textbf{Week 1\\Friday, January 9, 2015\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start working on the actual implementation
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up the weekly meeting with our TA
\item Set up our group meeting time
\item Requirements updated
\end{itemize}

\noindent Winter term begins and we get back to our project. In the first week, we scheduled a weekly meeting with our TA and updated the requirements. We broke down our project into 24 requirements and each member handles 8 of them. We are expected to complete 6 requirements at the end of this term and 2 for the next term. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 2\\Friday, January 16, 2015\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start working on the prototype API
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Updated requirements approved
\item Requirements completion list submitted
\end{itemize}

\noindent This week we got our new requirements approved and divided works to each member. We also started our implementation of prototype API using JavaScript. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 3\\Friday, January 23, 2015\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Working on the prototype API
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Updated requirements approved
\end{itemize}

\noindent Again we update one of the requirement to make it more specific and got it approved. After speaking with our sponsor, we decided to implement our prototype API as a Firefox addon instead of putting it into the Firefox core, while the C++ API will still need to be put into the core. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 4\\Friday, January 30, 2015\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Finish the implementation of the prototype API
\item Finish the first 9 requirements and get ready for demo
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Created a draft of the prototype API
\end{itemize}

\noindent This week we were working on the prototype API. Because our API will communicate between C++ and Javascript, we implement our prototype API as a XPCOM component. We succesfully installed the prototype API as an addon to the Firefox but we failed to call the C++ function in JavaScript. We will keep working on it and try to make the addon works in the next week. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 5\\Friday, February 6, 2015\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Finish the implementation of the prototype API
\item Test the prototype API on desktop, Android and Firefox OS
\item Demo the prototype API to the TA
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented the prototype API addon using addon SDK
\item Battery level, device charging state and network latency data are accessible from the prototype API
\end{itemize}

\noindent This week we were still working on the prototype API. Since the addon-via-manifest prototype API does not works well, we tried another method and implemented the addon via SDK. Also, it turns out that some of the functionality of our API are only available on the Firefox OS but not the desktop version. Therefore we need to write a new prototype for the Firefox OS device. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 6\\Friday, February 13, 2015\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start working on the actual API using C++ or Javascript
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Prototype API finished
\item Completed the demo of first 9 requirements to the TA
\end{itemize}

\noindent This week we finally finished the prototype API. The prototype can detect the battery level, charging state of the device, network connection type and shows latency-related information. We also changed our requirements after talking to the sponsor to scope the prototype down so that we have more time to focus on the actual API. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 7\\Friday, February 20, 2015\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Continue working on the actual API using C++ or Javascript
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start working on the actual API using C++ or Javascript
\end{itemize}

\noindent This week we keep on working on the API. A few weeks before we got a developer reference phone called Flame from our sponsor. We began testing our API on this Firefox OS device to make sure our API works on all platform of Firefox. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 8\\Friday, February 27, 2015\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Continue working on the API using C++ or Javascript
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Continue working on the API using C++ or JavaScript
\end{itemize}

\noindent This week we are still working on the API. Most of the functions of the actual API are same as the prototype API. Some new functions added to the actual API include collect network status information, access system load information and to integrate with existing API such as ServiceWorker and RequestSync. Each of our group member take charge of one of these function. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 9\\Friday, March 6, 2015\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Finish the next 9 requirements
\item Finish the implementation of the API
\end{itemize}

\noindent Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Continue working on the implementation of the API
\end{itemize}

\noindent We are going to demo the next 9 requirements to the TA in the final week. We hope to finish the implementation of our API next week and test it before we demo. \\
\\
\textbf{Week 10\\Friday, March 13, 2015\\}

\noindent Plans for coming week:
\begin{itemize}
